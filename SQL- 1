Overview of the Project

Project: Library Management System Database

Project Overview
The Library Management System Database is a simple database project designed to manage a library's book inventory, members, and borrow/return transactions. This project serves as a practical exercise for learning basic SQL commands and database design principles. It provides a foundation for understanding how to create, manipulate, and query a relational database.

Features
Book Management: Track books available in the library, including details like title, author, published year, genre, and available copies.
Member Management: Store information about library members, including their names, contact details, and membership dates.
Transaction Tracking: Record borrow and return transactions, linking members to the books they borrow.

SQL Commands

1. Creation of Tables
CREATE TABLE Books (
    book_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    author VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    published_year YEAR NOT NULL,
    genre VARCHAR(100),
    available_copies INT NOT NULL DEFAULT 1
);

CREATE TABLE Members (
    member_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    phone_number VARCHAR(15),
    membership_date DATE NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE Transactions (
    transaction_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    member_id INT,
    book_id INT,
    transaction_date DATE NOT NULL,
    return_date DATE,
    FOREIGN KEY (member_id) REFERENCES Members(member_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (book_id) REFERENCES Books(book_id)
);

2. Insertion of Data
INSERT INTO Books (title, author, published_year, genre, available_copies) VALUES
('To Kill a Mockingbird', 'Harper Lee', 1960, 'Fiction', 3),
('1984', 'George Orwell', 1949, 'Dystopian', 2),
('The Great Gatsby', 'F. Scott Fitzgerald', 1925, 'Classic', 5);

INSERT INTO Members (name, email, phone_number, membership_date) VALUES
('John Doe', 'john.doe@example.com', '1234567890', '2023-01-15'),
('Jane Smith', 'jane.smith@example.com', '0987654321', '2023-02-20');

INSERT INTO Transactions (member_id, book_id, transaction_date) VALUES
(1, 1, '2023-03-01'),  
(2, 2, '2023-03-02');  

3. Updation of Data
UPDATE Members SET phone_number = '1112223333' WHERE member_id = 1;

4. Deletion of Data
DELETE FROM Members WHERE member_id = 2;

DELETE FROM Books WHERE book_id = 3;  -- Deletes "The Great Gatsby"
